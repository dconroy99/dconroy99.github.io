### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 

    Lab 4, part 1 was a very fun part of the labs that we did throughout the 
    year. This is because is was very cool seeing how all of the formulas were
    able to stack and grow on from each other. This was also a useful because 
    converting measurments by hand can be confusing as this would make it a lot 
    easier.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites that we did because I really enjoy the
    game of blackjack in person. So it was fun to be able to build the game from
    scratch and make it work the way it was intended to. This lab was also fun 
    because it was difficult at first to make it work correctly with multiple aces.
    But once I finally got it, it was very cool which added to why I liked this 
    lab so much.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was also a really fun lab in my mind that we did this semester.
    The reason this lab was one of my favorites was because I found it super interesting
    trying to figure out how to put all of the lines of code togther throughout this
    lab for it to end up guessing a secret number. It was a little tricky tryign to 
    put this code together and took some time but once I figured it out it made me 
    look back at this lab and find it alot of fun.
